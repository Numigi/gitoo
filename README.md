## Abstract 
Gitoo downloads the add-ons from the given git repository and place them in the given folder.

During the process, only the folders of the add-on survive of the final move.
Elements like README, setup.py or even the folder .git are excluded from the move.
It keeps the folder light.

At [Numigi](www.numigi.com), gitoo is used to populate the dockers with the wanted odoo addons.

## Commands
gitoo contains the following command:

* [Install All](#install_all)

## <a name="install_all"></a> Install All

A tool for creating backups of a database.

```bash
gitoo install_all --conf_file gitoo.yml --destination /mnt/extra-addons
```

* The parameter `--conf_file` expects a path to a [config file](#gitoo_config_file).
The parameter defaults to `./third_party_addons.yaml`
* The parameter `--destination` expects the path where the add-ons should be copied to.
The parameter defaults to `./3rd/`


## <a name="git_config_file"></a>Config File

Gitoo uses a config file, in yml, to know what add-ons should be downloaded and how.

**Download odoo add-ons**

A typical config file to get odoo add-ons would look like:

``` yaml
- url: https://github.com/OCA/website
  branch: 11.0
  commit: 899a2219d35a259422ce916ba99947108bc3cc3c

- url: https://github.com/OCA/hr
  branch: 11.0
  commit: 0e72182eab23438edf444f4aae3a808d10784082
  patches:
    - url: https://github.com/Numigi/odoo-hr
      branch: 11.0-mig-hr_experience
      commit: 4af0fc7c353864b573dc4543c2f8ae59d168ba69
```

* The first section downloads the code of the repo website from the branch 11.0. It also forces
to be at a precise commit
* The second section shows how to apply patches

**Applying Patch From File**

To apply a patch directly from a .patch file instead of a git branch, you may do as follow:

``` yaml
- url: https://github.com/OCA/hr
  branch: 11.0
  commit: 0e72182eab23438edf444f4aae3a808d10784082
  patches:
    - file: relative/path/to/first.patch
    - file: relative/path/to/second.patch
```

**Special cas of Odoo source code**

Gitoo allows to manage the source code of odoo almost like any other code:
``` yaml
- url: https://github.com/odoo/odoo
  branch: "11.0"
  base: true
```
* The code downloads odoo from the branch 11.0. The argument base informs gitoo that the repo is actually 
the code of the application, not a simple add-on.
